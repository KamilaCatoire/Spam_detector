## Project

One of the primary challenges experienced by AT&T users is the persistent issue of receiving SPAM messages.

Although AT&T has been manually identifying and marking spam messages for a while, they are seeking an automated solution to detect spam and safeguard their users.

## Objectives

The project objective is to develop a spam detection system capable of automatically identifying and flagging spam messages based solely on their content.
